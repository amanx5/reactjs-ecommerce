# E-commerce Application

This project is a simple **e-commerce platform** originally built during the [SuperSimpleDev React course](https://courses.supersimple.dev/courses/react). It follows the tutorial content, but includes some enhancements:

- Fully typed using TypeScript (frontend & backend).
- Structured as a pnpm monorepo with separated `server/` and `ui/` packages.

## Overview

The workspace consists of two main packages:

- **server/** – a Node/Express backend providing REST APIs and data persistence.
- **ui/** – a React frontend built using Vite and TypeScript.

Both packages share common tooling and are managed with `pnpm` in a monorepo setup.

## Getting Started (Development)

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the server and client (from the repo root):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. Create `.env.development` file in `ui/` folder. Refer [ui/.env.example](ui/.env.example) for more details on ui env variables.
4. Create `.env.dev` file in `server/` folder. Refer [server/.env.example](server/.env.example) for more details on server env variables.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the UI.


## Deployment (Production)

To deploy the application on Render/Railway, follow these steps:

1. Create a new API Service.
2. Create a new DB service.
3. Set the build command to `pnpm build` (root package).
4. Set the start command to `pnpm start` (root package).
5. Set the environment variables. Refer [server/.env.example](server/.env.example) to know more about the environment variables.
6. Deploy the application.
